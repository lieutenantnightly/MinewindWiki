# Devilfish

The Devilfish was a [[mythical]] fish. The fish seems to have granted many buffs along with its stats. It was given to CntyMcShttr for winning the first Fishing Weekend in August of 2014. It is unknown, but this item may be the first Mythical on the server, possibly beating out [[lightbringer]] and [[misery]]. This item is the first Mythical given to a specific player for an achievement.
