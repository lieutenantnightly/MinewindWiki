# Builder's Hat

The Builder's Hat is a [[mythical]] Turtle helmet that was awarded to SliquifierC on his build of [[spawn]].

## Notes

- Grants the user Creative Flight similar to the [[hermes-boots]], but also grants the user a special [[aura]].
- The Hat has 2 Essence Slots, which the third is an unknown ability in terms of writing, because it does not show in the players /stats menu.
- It is one of the few in game items that has an ability that isnt shown on the /stats menu.
