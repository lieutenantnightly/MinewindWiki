# Events

There are many events on Minewind, some are seasonal and some are on a weekly basis.

There are different reasons to participate in Events. While seasonal events only reward players for farming it in a mostly uncompetetive way except for trying to snipe special event mobs for more rewards, weekly "Events" are rather competitions with loot and / or bragging rights as reward. 

## Hourly Events

Competitive/Co-op events that are hosted randomly every hour or two. These events often reward players for participation or scoring on the leaderboard. 

- [[attack-on-giant]]

- [[bait]]

- [[beef]]
- [[labyrinth]]

## Weekly Events

Are of competitive nature and hosted twice a week.
