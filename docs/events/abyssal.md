# Abyssal

Abyssal is an [[events|event]] that takes place in an underwater version of spawn. This is a PvP style event with more rewards the longer you survive. There is also a shrinking zone of play (created by a Minecraft World Border) that eventually will close entirely and kill everyone by 0:00 if nobody is declared winner, however there have been ways to survive in the closed border. If there are still players alive in this event when the next event is scheduled to start, it will not start, and Abyssal will continue.
