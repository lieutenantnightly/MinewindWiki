# Attack on Giant
Attack on Giant Event is an [[events|event]] that is hosted by the server throughout the day. It spawns Giant Zombies that sometimes spawn with armor. These giants blow up their surroundings and spawn Skeleton Masters and Skeleton Scouts that attack players. Although these zombies can be PvE and teamed up with, traditionally it is an event that is done solo, as other players can steal loot.

It is recommended that players keep a Dragon Egg, Ember, Key of Midas, Legendary Key of Midas, and Giant's Midas Key in their inventory, as it will quickly fill up with garbage. Allowing slots for this loot to fall into allows easy inventory management.
